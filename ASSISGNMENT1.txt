Challenges of Software Testing using ai

 1.Lack of Data Quality.
    High-quality data are essential for the training and performance of AI models.
    Collecting and managing such data might be difficult, especially for complex software systems. 
    Testers must often collect data on user interactions, system performance, and defect occurrences.
    Ensuring the AI model learns the correct patterns requires careful cleaning and accurate data labeling.

 2.Model Bias.
    Identifying and rectifying all defects, regardless of their type or severity, is crucial. 
    However, AI models can introduce bias in various ways, including selecting training data, algorithm choices, and evaluation methods.
  
 3.Cost and Complexity.
    Adopting AI in software testing may be complicated and expensive in the short term. 
    Infrastructure and specialist knowledge are necessary.
    Training and using AI models can be computationally demanding, frequently needing specialized hardware and software resources. 
    The difficulty grows by the possibility that testers will require training to use AI tools and procedures effectively. 
    
 4.Trust Issue
    Raising awareness and confidence among testers of AIâ€™s potential and limitations is difficult.
    Some testers can be reluctant to use AI because they need to understand its operation or doubt its potential.
    Because of this, informing them of the pros and cons of AI in software testing is crucial, fostering trust and confidence in its use.
